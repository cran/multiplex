
'multiplex' PACKAGE

version 1.5 (30-Apr-2015)
------------------------
ADDED FEATURES:
	+ NEW FUNCTION 'galois' provides Galois derivations between two subsets
	+ 'partial.order' has new argument to handle the Galois derivations
	+ Adjustments in 'read.srt' for attribute data files (to work with 'galois')
	+ Function 'transf' now transforms non-square arrays into lists
	+ Equations within generators are now reported in 'strings'
	+ Loops are now supported both in 'bundles' and 'bundle.census'
	+ 'bundles', 'summaryBundles' & 'rel.sys' allow specifying pairwise separator
	+ Now it is possible to disable the nodes' labels in 'bundles'
	+ Function 'read.gml' has a new argument for reading as srt or as array, and
	  now it can read GML files without the "graphics" tag used for multiplex ties
	+ Some needed internal functions now handle empty vectors or large semigroups

BUGS FIXED:
	* Fixed a small bug in 'cngr' when elements in a numerical semigroup are taken
	  sometimes(?) as characters
	* Bug fixed in 'bundle.census' when networks without actor labels have labeled
	  relations
	* 'bundles' handles properly two dimensional arrays with the form [n,m,1]

OTHER CHANGES:
	-+ For consistency reasons 'po.levels' is RENAMED into 'diagram.levels'
	- Internal function 'orden' is DEPREACTED


version 1.2 (5-Feb-2014)
------------------------
ADDED FEATURES:
	+ NEW FUNCTION 'po.levels' for classifying the elements in the partial order 
	  structure resulted from 'diagram'
	+ Function 'rels.sys' now includes the number of ties in the chosen relational
	  system (as size)
	+ Function 'read.srt' works now with valued data including reals
	+ Function 'rm.isol' now includes arrays with NULL labels (which usually 
	  results from the 'reduc' function)

BUGS FIXED:
	* Function 'read.srt' works now properly with single networks
	* Fixed a bug in 'bundles' for simple patterns not occurring in the network
	* Fixed a small bug in 'bundles' for tie exchange when a matrix is specified
	* Function 'bundle.census' now stops when the input data is not an array


version 1.0 (28-Aug-2013)
