
'multiplex' PACKAGE


version 1.8 (4-Mar-2016)
------------------------

ADDED FEATURES:
	+ 'rel.sys' allows transformations from arrays to pair-lists and vice-versa
	+ 'perm' and 'reduc' accepts non-sequential integers, character, and NAs in 
	  clustering. 
	+ 'perm' has also a new argument to reverse the clustering order
	+ 'neighb' can use integers to refer the actors

BUGS FIXED:
	* 'diagram.levels' failed to process single layered partial order structures
	* 'neighb' does not give an error for systems with k=1 and expand=TRUE
	* 'signed' has been re-written and now it works properly

OTHER CHANGES:
	+ output labels in 'bundles' now matches the labels of 'summaryBundles'
	+ Function 'read.gml' can import the coordenated system (with new internals)


version 1.7.1 (3-Sep-2015)
--------------------------
Vignette is fixed.


version 1.7 (1-Sep-2015)
------------------------
ADDED FEATURES:
	+ NEW FUNCTION 'neighb' for finding the neighbourhood of an actor or a group
	  of actors with customized distances
	+ NEW FUNCTION 'as.signed' for coercing an object into a "Signed" class
	+ Function 'expos' depends only from the output of 'rel.sys', it has new 
	  arguments, and it is generalized to various kinds of node attributes
	+ 'rel.sys' supports loops, actor attributes, and reports pairwise separator
	+ Function 'fltr' has new argument to make explicit finding principal ideals,
	  and now the reference element can be a named object or an atribute as well
	+ Data sets include also the original matrices with their images
	+ 'dichot' supports non-positive cut-off real values
	+ 'summaryBundles' has new argument for expanding tie patterns and collapsing
	  tie labels
	+ Small improvements in internal functions; 'flt' is added

BUG FIXED:
	* 'write.srt' failed to process networks without isolated actors

OTHER CHANGES:
	+ Namespaces for needed global functions have been added (CRAN request)
	- Internal function 'slc' is DEPREACTED
	+ Vignette is expanded


version 1.6 (19-May-2015)
-------------------------
ADDED FEATURES:
	+ NEW FUNCTION 'fltr' to find principal filters (or ideals) in partial orders
	+ Small improvements in internal functions

BUG FIXED:
	* Fixed bug in the full labeling of 'galois', which can have consequences in
	  the partial ordering of the concepts


version 1.5 (30-Apr-2015)
-------------------------
ADDED FEATURES:
	+ NEW FUNCTION 'galois' provides Galois derivations between two subsets
	+ 'partial.order' has new argument to handle the Galois derivations
	+ Adjustments in 'read.srt' for attribute data files (to work with 'galois')
	+ Function 'transf' now transforms non-square arrays into lists
	+ Equations within generators are now reported in 'strings'
	+ Loops are now supported both in 'bundles' and 'bundle.census'
	+ 'bundles', 'summaryBundles' & 'rel.sys' allow specifying pairwise separator
	+ Now it is possible to disable the nodes' labels in 'bundles'
	+ Function 'read.gml' has a new argument for reading as srt or as array, and
	  now it can read GML files without the "graphics" tag used for multiplex ties
	+ Some needed internal functions now handle empty vectors or large semigroups
	+ VIGNETTE is added

BUGS FIXED:
	* Fixed a small bug in 'cngr' when elements in a numerical semigroup are taken
	  sometimes(?) as characters
	* Bug fixed in 'bundle.census' when networks without actor labels have labeled
	  relations
	* 'bundles' handles properly two dimensional arrays with the form [n,m,1]

OTHER CHANGES:
	-+ For consistency reasons 'po.levels' is RENAMED into 'diagram.levels'
	- Internal function 'orden' is DEPREACTED


version 1.2 (5-Feb-2014)
------------------------
ADDED FEATURES:
	+ NEW FUNCTION 'po.levels' for classifying the elements in the partial order 
	  structure resulted from 'diagram'
	+ Function 'rels.sys' now includes the number of ties in the chosen relational
	  system (as size)
	+ Function 'read.srt' works now with valued data including reals
	+ Function 'rm.isol' now includes arrays with NULL labels (which usually 
	  results from the 'reduc' function)

BUGS FIXED:
	* Function 'read.srt' works now properly with single networks
	* Fixed a bug in 'bundles' for simple patterns not occurring in the network
	* Fixed a small bug in 'bundles' for tie exchange when a matrix is specified
	* Function 'bundle.census' now stops when the input data is not an array


version 1.0 (28-Aug-2013)
-------------------------
	+ Package is RELEASED
